Q: Data set from UU InfoLab
Q: Is getting air traffic dataset from some statistical bureue (American, European, etc.) 


1. Install BioNEV package according to the instructions in the README here: https://github.com/xiangyue9607/BioNEV.
2. Place the edgelist file into the "data" folder. The edgelist can be obtained using the code from "# Export edgelist" section in "kmeans.py".
3. Run the command "bionev --input ../node2vec/graph/les_miserables_int.edgelist --output ./embeddings/les_miserables_struc2vec.emb --method struc2vec --task link-prediction --walk-length 80 --window-size 10 --dimensions 16"
4. Place the output file into "\node2vec\emb\".
